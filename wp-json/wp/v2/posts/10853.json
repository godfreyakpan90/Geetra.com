The answer varies depending on factors like the duration of your visit and the purpose of your trip. However, non-U.S. citizens can seek car insurance policies whether they&#8217;re here long-term or just visiting as a tourist or on a visa. With nearly 45 million immigrants living in the US, there&#8217;s a significant demand for this type of coverage. Fortunately, many top US car insurance companies offer competitive options for foreign drivers in need of coverage.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Do_I_Need_to_Buy_Car_Insurance_if_I_Visit_the_US\"><\/span>Do I Need to Buy Car Insurance if I Visit the U.S.?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>All non-US citizens who intend to drive a vehicle in the US are required to have car insurance (except in New Hampshire), regardless of the length of their stay.<\/p>\n<p>If you intend to drive a rental car, the rental company usually provides the option to purchase coverage for the entire rental period, which also covers the rental vehicle itself.<\/p>\n<p>If you decide to bring your foreign vehicle to the U.S., you will need to obtain a separate car insurance policy before you can drive it on American roads.<\/p>\n<p>However, there are many affordable car insurance companies that can assist you in finding the appropriate coverage for your foreign vehicle. By working with one of these insurers, you can ensure that you have the right amount of coverage at a price that fits your budget, allowing you to hit the road as soon as your vehicle arrives.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.statefarm.com\/content\/dam\/sf-library\/en-us\/secure\/legacy\/simple-insights\/auto-insurance-foreign-drivers.jpg\" alt=\"U.S. Car Insurance Requirements\" width=\"750\" height=\"421\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"US_Car_Insurance_Requirements\"><\/span>U.S. Car Insurance Requirements<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The car insurance requirements for foreign drivers in the U.S. vary by state. Every state has its own set of rules and regulations regarding car insurance.<\/p>\n<p>Most states only require liability insurance to legally drive, which covers damages and losses caused to others. However, a few states also mandate underinsured\/uninsured motorist insurance, which covers your expenses if the at-fault party is uninsured or underinsured.<\/p>\n<p>In states that follow the no-fault insurance system, drivers are required to have coverage for personal injury protection (PIP) and\/or medical payments to cover their medical expenses, regardless of who is at fault for the accident.<\/p>\n<p>Liability coverage is still required in these states and drivers remain liable for the damages they cause in a collision. PIP covers medical expenses, lost wages, childcare expenses, and other household services, regardless of fault. On the other hand, medical payments coverage only covers medical expenses.<\/p>\n<p>Car insurance rates in the United States can vary depending on where you live due to factors such as the local cost of living, population density, and crash statistics.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, your insurance rates will depend on the type of coverage you choose, whether it be full or minimum car insurance coverage. While minimum coverage is often less expensive, it may leave you vulnerable financially in the event of an accident.<\/p>\n<p>This is because it does not cover the full amount of damages and does not include coverage for damage to your own vehicle. On the other hand, full coverage car insurance includes coverage for your vehicle, may include other optional types of coverage, and is more likely to provide financial protection.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"US_Car_Insurance_for_Short-Term_Visitors\"><\/span>U.S. Car Insurance for Short-Term Visitors<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>For those who are short-term visitors in the US, renting a car is a common option. Rental car insurance can be purchased from the car rental company and is often the most practical choice for short stays, whether for business or personal reasons. Stand-alone car insurance providers may not offer insurance policies to those staying in the US for only a brief period.<\/p>\n<p>Rental car insurance options usually include liability coverage, collision coverage\/loss-and-damage waiver, personal effects coverage, and personal accident coverage.<\/p>\n<p>Canadian drivers can generally use their existing auto insurance while in the US, and their insurance may also cover rental cars. It&#8217;s advisable to confirm the details of your car insurance with your insurance company and rental car company before traveling.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"US_Car_Insurance_for_Long-Term_Visitors\"><\/span>U.S. Car Insurance for Long-Term Visitors<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If you are a longer-stay visitor in the U.S., such as a student or specialized worker on a visa, obtaining affordable insurance coverage may be difficult if you don&#8217;t have a U.S. driver&#8217;s license. However, the positive news is that non-U.S. citizens can still get car insurance.<\/p>\n<p>For longer-term visitors, it may be beneficial to apply for a U.S. driver&#8217;s license, even if they already possess a foreign license. Holding an American license and driving record may help foreign drivers in the future to save money on car insurance.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Car_Insurance_with_International_Drivers_Permits_%E2%80%93_IDP\"><\/span>Car Insurance with International Drivers Permits &#8211; IDP<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re planning to drive temporarily in the USA with a foreign driver&#8217;s license, make sure you&#8217;re aware of the local rules regarding the validity period. In most states, you can drive with your overseas license for up to three months, but it&#8217;s important to check the specific regulations in the state you&#8217;ll be visiting.<\/p>\n<p>For longer stays, some states recommend obtaining an international driver&#8217;s permit (IDP), even if it&#8217;s not mandatory. An IDP is a translation of your foreign driver&#8217;s license, which can help if you&#8217;re pulled over by law enforcement. You can obtain an IDP by contacting your home country&#8217;s traffic or motor vehicles agency and applying for one in advance of your trip. It typically takes around two weeks to receive an IDP, which is valid for one year and includes your photo and driver information.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Best_Insurance_Companies_for_Foreign_Drivers_in_the_US\"><\/span>The Best Insurance Companies for Foreign Drivers in the U.S.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Below is a compilation of car insurance providers that offer coverage for drivers with non-U.S. driver&#8217;s licenses:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bristol West<\/li>\n<li>Dairyland<\/li>\n<li>Infinity<\/li>\n<li>Kemper<\/li>\n<li>The General<\/li>\n<li>Hallmark<\/li>\n<li>Gainsco<\/li>\n<li>Assurance America<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em><strong>Further Reading&gt;&gt;&gt;<\/strong><\/em><\/span>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/geetracom.local\/car-insurance-without-a-license\/\">How to Get Car Insurance without a License | Recommended Options<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Whats_the_average_cost_of_car_insurance_in_America\"><\/span>What&#8217;s the average cost of car insurance in America?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The typical cost of car insurance in the U.S. is approximately $1,529 annually.

Most car insurance companies require a driver&#8217;s license before they can sell you a policy, which means that you must have a valid license to apply for insurance.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, only 11 U.S. states and Washington, D.C. have policies that allow undocumented immigrants to obtain driver&#8217;s licenses. You can apply for a license through the state&#8217;s DMV or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. In states that issue driver&#8217;s licenses to undocumented immigrants, insurance companies are allowed to sell policies to individuals who don&#8217;t have proof of legal presence in the U.S.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"States_that_Allow_Undocumented_Citizens_to_Obtain_a_License\"><\/span>States that Allow Undocumented Citizens to Obtain a License:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">California<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Colorado<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Connecticut<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Hawaii<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Illinois<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Maryland<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">New Mexico<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Nevada<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Utah<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Vermont<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Washington<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In conclusion, foreign drivers in the USA can obtain car insurance by considering the requirements of the state they will be driving in, whether they are driving their own vehicle or a rental, and their driving history.

Much of the castle&#8217;s architecture dates back to the sixteenth century, while a striking Victorian military barracks occupies another prominent outcrop. This area also houses the National War Museum of Scotland, showcasing Scotland&#8217;s military heritage. Visitors can marvel at Mons Meg, a fifteenth-century siege gun, and experience the traditional One O&#8217;Clock Gun, a daily artillery volley fired from the ramparts at the same time. The Crown Jewels, including the crown, scepter, and sword of state, as well as the Stone of Destiny, integral to the knighting ceremony of Scottish kings, are among the treasured exhibits on display.<\/p>\n<p>A visit to Edinburgh Castle offers an immersive journey through Scotland&#8217;s rich history, combining royal legacies, military prowess, and architectural grandeur.

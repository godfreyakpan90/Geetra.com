By doing so, the auto insurance company assumes less risk because they will not provide coverage for you or your vehicle if you happen to drive the car and get into an accident.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Update your Car&#8217;s Registration Information.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you are having trouble finding an insurance provider due to your lack of a license, you could contemplate making a licensed driver the co-owner of your vehicle on the registration. This can improve your chances of obtaining insurance since vehicle ownership is typically a prerequisite. The process of changing the registration to reflect the new ownership is uncomplicated and often involves visiting your local DMV, submitting a form, and paying a fee.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li id=\"parked\"><strong>Get Parked Car Insurance<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To obtain insurance for your car while it&#8217;s parked and not being driven, you can consider getting parked car insurance. This type of insurance policy is designed for vehicles that are not being used for a certain period of time, such as during winter or when you&#8217;re out of town, and provides protection against theft, vandalism, and other risks.<\/p>\n<p>It is not necessary to have a driver&#8217;s license for parked-car insurance as the insured vehicle will not be driven. This means that auto insurers may not require a license to provide coverage. Additionally, parked-car insurance policies are usually less expensive than standard auto insurance policies that provide liability coverage.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"suspended-license\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Can_I_Get_Car_Insurance_with_a_Suspended_License\"><\/span>Can I Get Car Insurance with a Suspended License<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If your driver&#8217;s license has been suspended, your options for auto insurance will be different from those who have never held a license or have had it revoked. Suspension of a license often results from a serious traffic offense, such as driving under the influence (DUI) or driving without insurance. Typically, to reinstate their driving privileges, the driver must obtain SR-22 insurance.<\/p>\n<p>To save money while your license is suspended, you should consider getting parked car insurance or a nonowner policy instead of canceling your policy altogether. Maintaining comprehensive insurance can help you avoid a coverage lapse, which could lead to an increase in future insurance premiums and denial of coverage from reputable insurers.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"buying-a-car\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Can_I_Buy_a_Car_without_a_Drivers_License\"><\/span>Can I Buy a Car without a Driver&#8217;s License<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Just like buying car insurance, you do not necessarily need a driver&#8217;s license to purchase a car. Nonetheless, without a license, test-driving the vehicle or driving it away from the dealership is not possible. Even if it is permitted, auto dealerships are often hesitant to provide financing to customers who lack a license. Your chances of securing a car loan without a license may improve if you approach a local bank that doesn&#8217;t require a license for this type of loan.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"registering-a-car\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Can_I_Register_a_Car_with_No_License\"><\/span>Can I Register a Car with No License<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>You do not always require a driver&#8217;s license to register a car. In many states, you can complete the registration process by submitting the necessary documents, paying the fee, and presenting proof of insurance to your state&#8217;s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em><strong>Further Reading&gt;&gt;&gt;<\/strong><\/em><\/span>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/geetra.com\/no-down-payment-car-insurance\/\">Get Insured With Companies Offering No down Payment Car Insurance<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Get Car Insurance without a License &#8211; Learn about recommended options for getting car insurance without a license, including being listed as an excluded driver or getting parked car insurance.

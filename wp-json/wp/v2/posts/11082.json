Whether you prefer on-campus residences or off-campus apartments for rent, this comprehensive article offers insights tailored to your needs.<\/p>\n<p>Securing suitable accommodation in Canada can be quite daunting, especially for international students. We recognize the challenges you may face, and to simplify your search, we have carefully curated a list of the most affordable accommodation options for international students in Canada in 2023.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Types_of_Cheap_Accommodation_In_Canada\"><\/span><strong>Types of Cheap Accommodation<\/strong>\u00a0<strong>In Canada<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>There are different housing options to choose from if you want to study in Canada. They can be on-campus or off-campus, temporary or permanent, and even shared or private apartments.<\/p>\n<p>Most Canadian schools offer assistance to international students to find suitable housing options.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the types of student accommodations you can find in Canada;<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Dormitories\"><\/span><strong>Dormitories<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Dormitories are large on-campus<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>houses usually built in the form of hostels; some school dormitories can accommodate up to 30000 students per academic year. Each student is assigned to a dorm\/room which they share with other 4-5 students of the same gender. Students also share facilities like kitchens, bathrooms and study areas.<\/p>\n<p>This type of accommodation is recommended mostly for first year students because of its close proximity to the main campus.<\/p>\n<p>Dormitories are affordable and give students the opportunity to make friendly connections early in the course of their study.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Average cost\u00a0<\/strong>: 250 &#8211; 600 CAD per month<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Townhouses\"><\/span><strong>Townhouses<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This is another student residence usually\u00a0reserved for upper year students who wish to live on-campus. Although they are not as large as dormitories, they usually contain about three to six bedrooms and can accommodate up to 10 students at a time.<\/p>\n<p>Townhouses offer more privacy with single occupancy rooms which you do not have to share with a roommate. You also get access to a personal kitchen area or cafeteria where you can purchase regular meals, a bathroom and utilities such as Internet at an affordable price.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Average cost:\u00a0<\/strong>250 &#8211; 650 CAD per month.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Private_Rentals\"><\/span><strong>Private Rentals<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>These types of apartments are suitable for students who have a higher budget. The cost of private rentals can be quite high, you can find other students looking for similar accommodation and share the cost.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Average cost: 1200 &#8211; 2500CAD<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Shared_Apartments\"><\/span><strong>Shared Apartments<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Shared Apartments are usually off-campus residences where you can get single rooms in an apartment shared with other students. Similar to townhouses, they offer single rooms with shared kitchen, study and living room.<\/p>\n<p>They can be very expensive in big cities like Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal. It is the second best option for students who do not want to live on campus. You shouldn&#8217;t depend too much on your university for assistance with this type of accommodation.\u00a0However, the schools may refer you to trustworthy agencies that can provide the housing services you need.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Average cost: 400 &#8211; 800CAD<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Home_stay\"><\/span><strong>Home stay<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Home stays offer international students the opportunity to live with Canadian families during the course of their study. Staying in a host family provides you with a furnished private room, 24\/7 internet access, 1-3 meals daily. You also get to learn more about Canadian culture and interact with families from different ethnicities.<\/p>\n<p>In most host housing, the family does the cleaning and cooking so you get more time to focus on your studies and enjoy an active social life.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Average Cost: 375 &#8211; 800CAD<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Sublets\"><\/span><strong>Sublets<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>A sublet is an apartment rented by a single person or student whose name is on the lease, temporarily rents out spaces\/rooms in the same apartment to other students at a reduced fee.<\/p>\n<p>It is an affordable option for students with a tight budget. The lease is valid for the academic year before it is passed to another student or individual. This type of special arrangement only works if the landlord has an agreement with the students.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Average cost: $900 &#8211; $1500 CAD<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Factors_To_Consider_When_Choosing_a_Cheap_Accommodation_In_Canada\"><\/span><strong>Factors To Consider When Choosing a Cheap Accommodation In Canada<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>There are certain things to look out for when searching for the perfect accommodation in Canada for international students.

Before you rent any apartment, inquire about the utilities that will be provided during your stay.<\/p>\n<p>Utilities like hot water, meal plans, Internet, television should be available for you to live comfortably and focus fully on your academics. If you have any special needs or requirements\u00a0 you must inform your accommodation provider before completing your rent.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Distance_to_schoolcampus\"><\/span><strong>Distance to school\/campus<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Distance and Location is another factor to keep in mind when searching for an off-campus accommodation.\u00a0A quick trip from your apartment to school should not be more than an hour.<\/p>\n<p>Long drives or trips to campus can affect your schedule and eat into your study time. You should be able to trek, drive or take a bus to school with ease.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Type_of_Housing\"><\/span><strong>Type of Housing<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>In Canada, there is a range of student housing options to choose from. Its up to you to decide the type of accommodation that best suits your lifestyle. If you&#8217;re someone that enjoys privacy, it&#8217;s less likely that you&#8217;ll be comfortable in a school dormitory.
